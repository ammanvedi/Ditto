Ditto
=====

Ditto is a java program that allows a user to capture a portion of their screen, 
the app then uses the imgur api to upload the screenshot to imgur and display the resulting link to the user.

I used to like gyazo, but they started to use advertising, so I built this. with the help of Andrew K (UI)
